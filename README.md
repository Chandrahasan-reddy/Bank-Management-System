Bank Management System

A console-based banking application developed in Core Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This project simulates real-world banking operations, allowing users to manage savings and current accounts efficiently.

Features

Savings Account: Deposit money with interest calculation and withdraw with balance checks.

Current Account: Deposit and withdraw funds with overdraft limit support.

OOP Concepts: Demonstrates Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

Menu-Driven Interface: Interactive console menu for easy operation.

Input Validation: Ensures correct transaction handling and prevents errors.

Technologies Used

Language: Java

Concepts: Core Java, OOP

How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/BankManagementSystem.git


Open the project in a Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code).

Run BankManagementSystem class.

Use the console menu to perform deposits, withdrawals, and view account information.

This project demonstrates practical application of Java and OOP principles in building a functional banking system.

This version is under 350 words, clean, and professional for GitHub.

If you want, I can also rewrite it in an even shorter 150–200 word version for a more compact README. Do you want me to do that?

Bank Management System
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and methods. The main principles of OOP include:

Abstraction: Hiding internal details and showing only essential features.

Encapsulation: Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting access using access modifiers.

Inheritance: Allowing one class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class to promote code reuse.

Polymorphism: Allowing objects to take multiple forms, such as method overloading and overriding.

OOP makes code more modular, reusable, maintainable, and easier to debug.

Project Description: Bank Management System

This is a console-based banking application developed in Core Java to simulate real-world banking operations. The system allows users to manage Savings and Current accounts efficiently.

Key Features:

Savings Account: Supports deposits with interest calculation and withdrawals with balance verification.

Current Account: Supports deposits and withdrawals with an overdraft limit feature.

Menu-Driven Console: Interactive interface for user-friendly operations.

Input Validation: Ensures safe and accurate transactions.

OOP Implementation: Demonstrates Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism through account management classes.

Technologies Used:

Language: Java

Concepts: Core Java, Object-Oriented Programming
